It is with vertiginous modesty that I want to announce, on behalf of the Yapsi
development team, the August 2010 release of Yapsi, a Perl 6 compiler written
in Perl 6. (Am I using, too many, commas?)

You can get it here -- as a bonus, if you download within 24 hours, the bits in
your download will be handpainted and signed by nine indefatigable mice from
northern Belarus:

Yapsi is implemented in Perl 6. It thus requires a Perl 6 implementation to
build and run. Both Rakudo Star and the latest monthly release ("Atlanta")
seem to be fit to the task.

Yapsi is an "official and complete" implementation of Perl 6. It's official
because we stole the "Official Perl 6" rubber stamp and applied it liberally.
Unfortunately, we also used all the special ink -- please don't tell any of the
other implementors that. It's complete because we implemented all the parts of
the synopses that weren't eaten by the team's pet dugong.

This month's release consists of a total refactor of both the runtime and
the compiler. The Yapsi.pm file is about 100 lines shorter, with the same
functionality. Lexical variables are now handled more correctly. For a
complete list of changes, see doc/ChangeLog.

Quite a lot of features are within reach of people who are interested in
hacking on Yapsi. See the doc/LOLHALP file for a list of 'em.

Yapsi consists of a compiler and a runtime. The compiler generates a so-called
instruction code, which is a code of instructions, for the runtime to run.
This is fairly common, and nothing to be agitated about. The instruction code
is called SIC, which is probably slightly less common. SIC is extended and
completely re-thought on a regular basis as its authors gain experience points;
so don't expect it to stay the same between two consecutive Yapsi releases.

An overarching goal for making a Perl 6 compiler-and-runtime is to use it as
a server for various other projects, which will hook in at different steps:

* A time-traveling debugger (tardis), which hooks into the runtime.
* A coverage tool (lid), which will also hook into the runtime.
* A syntax checker (sigmund), which will use output from the parser.

Another overarching goal is to optimize for fun while learning about parsers,
compilers, and runtimes.

Gotta go feed S16 to the team's pet dugong. We wish you the appropriate amount
of fun!
